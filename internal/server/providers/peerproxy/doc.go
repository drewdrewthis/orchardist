// Package peerproxy implements the federation provider — the layer that
// turns a remote orchard daemon into a backend just like git, tmux or
// ps. Per ADR-011 §7, federation is not a special protocol: the local
// daemon talks GraphQL to the remote daemon and the resolvers cannot
// tell the difference between a local provider and the proxy.
//
// Layering (see ADR-011 §2):
//
//	provider.go — Provider[NodeID, Node]; resolver-facing surface,
//	              fans out to per-peer adapters.
//	adapter.go  — one Adapter per peer; owns its Subscribe loop and
//	              fans the watcher channel out as InvalidationEvent.
//	client.go   — websocket + HTTP transport; speaks the
//	              graphql-transport-ws subprotocol for subscriptions
//	              and POSTs JSON for one-shot queries. HTTPS/WSS
//	              enabled per-peer via `tls: true` in config.
//	keepalive.go — read- and write-deadline policy for the peer
//	              websocket. Reads carry a silence budget (defaultReadWait,
//	              30s) with control-frame handlers that re-arm it, so a
//	              half-open socket errors out into the reconnect path
//	              instead of parking a read forever. Writes carry a send
//	              budget (defaultWriteWait, 10s) armed fresh per send, so a
//	              peer whose receive window has filled cannot park a write
//	              forever; a write timeout feeds failAll — the same
//	              teardown-and-redial path as a read timeout — so the
//	              subscription errors and the next Subscribe redials rather
//	              than hanging (worst case: the ctx-teardown `complete`
//	              write parking while it holds writeMu).
//	config.go   — loads peer addresses from
//	              ~/.orchard/config.json. Read-only.
//
// Auth: peer authentication is delegated to the transport. For TLS-enabled
// peers (e.g. boxd-fronted endpoints), the transport-level allowlist on
// the boxd subdomain is the security boundary. For plaintext peers, the
// LAN itself is the boundary. The daemon does not implement an
// application-level bearer-secret guard — that approach was removed in
// issue #412 because the operational complexity (CLI auth lockout,
// fsnotify reload edge cases) outweighed the security gain over TLS.
//
// Failure model: the adapter never silently swallows errors. A failed
// websocket open marks the peer unreachable, the next dashboard query
// reflects `reachable: false`, and Subscribe() retries on a coarse
// backoff. Cross-host node lookups bubble the underlying network error
// to the resolver.
