// ---- local tmux lane: which session is THIS client on, right now.
//
// The daemon's tmuxSessions.attached is per-SESSION and global — it answers
// "is anyone looking at this session", never "am I looking at it". It is also
// a poll behind. Both problems land on the one thing the sidebar most needs to
// be right and instant: which card carries the bar. So attach state is read
// from tmux directly, on a fast local tick.
//
// This is a deliberate exception to ADR-016/017/018 (clients don't exec tmux),
// taken on the user's explicit instruction after the daemon path measured too
// slow to use. The daemon still owns everything else: session inventory,
// claude state, model, PR/issue join. Tracked with switchClient under #726.
