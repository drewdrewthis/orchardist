// prStatus collapses the PR's several GitHub enums into the one word that most
// needs acting on, worst-first: merged, closed, draft, conflicts, failing,
// unresolved, green.
//
// "green" is deliberately the narrowest branch — only a literal SUCCESS rollup
// with an APPROVED review earns it. Anything the rollup doesn't positively
// confirm (PENDING, EXPECTED, empty, an enum we don't know) reads as
// "unresolved", never as green: see sol.2026-07-14-daemon-checkrollup-reports-
// false-green, where a rollup-derived verdict showed failing checks as clean.
